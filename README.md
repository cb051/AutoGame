# AutoGame
This project explores classes through a 'game'. User can run 'javac AutoTest.java' or 'javac AutoTest2.java' from command line to see how project works. Cars can drive a specified distance and their x,y coordinates will be printed to the screen. You will also see when an car runs out of gas. The specifics for each car are decided by 'AutoTest.java' and 'AutoTest2.java' but can be further manipulated by user.
